# MDWA PhD Research Repository - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This repository contains research documentation and visualization tools for "Multi-Device Web Artwork: An Interactive, Semantic, and Modular approach for Systems Art" - a PhD qualifying research project.

## Research Context
**Researcher**: Jeanyoon Choi (Year 2, Industrial Design Department)
**Research Title**: Multi-Device Web Artwork (MDWA) framework for Interactive Systems Art
**Date**: June 10, 2025

### Key Research Concepts
- **MDWA**: Multi-Device Web Artwork - interactive computational art across multiple web-connected devices
- **SbA**: State-based Architecture - structural framework for managing complex system dynamics
- **DT**: Dimensional Transformation - process mediating between input/system/output states
- **Systems Art**: Art focusing on dynamic processes, relationships, and emergent behaviors
- **Research-through-Exhibition**: Methodology validating frameworks through public art exhibitions

### Research Gaps Being Addressed
1. **Interactive Gap**: Limited user agency in current Systems Art practices
2. **Semantic Gap**: Lack of meaningful information/symbolic engagement beyond audio-visual effects  
3. **Modular Gap**: Non-standardized, context-specific configurations limiting accessibility

## Core Framework Components

### Four State Types in SbA:
1. **Interactive Input States**: Status of input channels and user interaction modalities
2. **System Input States**: Processed inputs feeding into artwork's core system logic
3. **System Output States**: Outputs generated by core system dynamics
4. **Visual Output States**: Perceivable forms across output devices

### Five-Stage DT Workflow:
1. Interactive Input Modalities → 2. Input Dimensional Transformation → 3. System Dynamics → 4. Output Dimensional Transformation → 5. Perceptual Output

## Repository Structure

### `/graphs/` - DOT Visualization Files
Contains five progressive figures illustrating MDWA framework evolution:
- **Figure 1**: `figure1_simple_interaction.dot` - Basic input-output model
- **Figure 2**: `figure2_state_based_approach.dot` - SbA with four state types
- **Figure 3**: [TBD] Multi-device architecture
- **Figure 4**: [TBD] Dimensional Transformation integration
- **Figure 5**: [TBD] Complete MDWA framework

### Core Files
- `index.html` & `interactive.html`: Web-based DOT visualization tools
- `viz-standalone.js`: Graphviz rendering engine
- Existing `.dot` files: Previous graph examples

## Technical Requirements

### DOT Graph Specifications
- Use **Graphviz DOT language** for all visualizations
- Follow consistent color coding:
  - Blue (#2196F3): Input layer/devices
  - Purple (#9C27B0): System core/dynamics  
  - Orange (#FF9800): Output layer/devices
  - Gray (#666666): Transformations/connections
- Include clear labels and hierarchical clustering
- Use `rankdir=LR` (left-to-right) layout
- Mobile devices: tall narrow boxes (0.8x1.2)
- Desktop/projectors: wide boxes (1.5x1.0)
- States: ellipses with appropriate fill colors

### Coding Style
- **Language Appreciation**: Use existing tech stack (HTML/JS for web visualization)
- **No package manager preference**: Repository uses standard web technologies
- Clean, academic-appropriate documentation
- Consistent naming conventions using snake_case for files

## Research Methodology
- **Practice-based Research**: Knowledge through creative practice and reflection
- **Research-through-Design**: Insights via making and iteration  
- **Research-through-Exhibition**: Validation through public art exhibitions

## Key Literature & Influences
- Burnham (1968): Systems Art foundations
- Harel (1987): Statecharts for complex systems
- Hunt et al. (2003): Parametric mapping in instrument design
- Brudy et al. (2019): Cross-device interaction taxonomy
- Morton (2013): Hyperobjects and complex systems

## Academic Requirements
- Original empirical research through three MDWA case studies
- Exhibition validation with real audience engagement
- Contribution to Systems Art, Interactive Art, and HCI communities
- Research-through-Exhibition methodology bridging art and design research

## File Naming Conventions
- DOT files: `figure[N]_descriptive_name.dot`
- Documentation: Clear, academic-style naming
- No special characters in paths
- Use underscores for multi-word filenames

## Visual Design Principles
- Clean, academic visualization style
- Clear hierarchical information structure
- Consistent color coding across all figures
- Emphasis on system relationships and data flow
- Professional presentation suitable for PhD documentation
